# Graph DS

### Examples of types of Graphs
  - Directed - each node has a direction(s) it eeds to go in
  - Undirected - there is no beginning or end

### Acylic Graph
- There is a point where the cycle ends
- A DAG is basically a directed tree (direct acylic graph)

### Cyclic Graph
- You can end up where you started

### Complete Graph
- Every node/vertices connects to every other node/vertices

### Connected Graph
- Everything is connected in some way
- There is no vertices that is not connected in some way

### Disconnected Graph (islands)
- Some vertices may be connected, some may not be connected

### Data Representation
- #1 Adjacency List
- #2 Adjaceny Matrix
- #3 Nodes

### Adjacency List
A > B > F
B > A > C > E
C > B > D
D > C > E
E > B > D > F
F > A > E
