Write the following methods for the Linked List class:

* .append(value) which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
* .insertBefore(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node
* .insertAfter(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node

Write the following tests:

* Can successfully add a node to the end of the linked list
* Can successfully add multiple nodes to the end of a linked list
* Can successfully insert a node before a node located i the middle of a linked list
* Can successfully insert a node before the first node of a linked list
* Can successfully insert after a node in the middle of the linked list
* Can successfully insert a node after the last node of the linked list

Write the following method for the Linked List class:

* Write a method for the Linked List class which takes a number, k, as a parameter. Return the node’s value that is k from the end of the linked list. You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.

Write the following tests:

* Where k is greater than the length of the linked list
* Where k and the length of the list are the same
* Where k is not a positive integer
* Where the linked list is of a size 1
* “Happy Path” where k is not at the end, but somewhere in the middle of the linked list
