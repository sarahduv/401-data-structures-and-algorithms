# Reverse an Array

## Challenge
Write a function that takes in an array, and reverses it. Do so without using the .reverse method.

## Approach & Efficiency
I made an empty array, and then used a for loop to iterate over the test array. While looping through the array in reverse, I pushed into the new array.

## Solution
